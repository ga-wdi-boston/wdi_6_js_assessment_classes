///// Question 1
// Define a class called `Cat`, with an initializer that accepts a `name`,
// an `age`, and a `color`, and stores these values as properties.

function Cat(name, age, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.color = color;
}

///// Question 2
// Add a function called `description` to the `Cat` class that returns a string
// describing the cat in this format: "<name> is a <age>-year-old <color> cat."

Cat.prototype.description = function() {
  return this.name + " is a " + this.age + "-year-old " + this.color + " cat.";
};

///// Question 3
// Create a new instance of the `Cat` class (make up an age, name, and color)
// and assign it to a variable.

minus = new Cat("Minus", 8, "Black");

///// Question 4
// Call the `description` function on the `Cat` instance you created in the
// previous question, and store the result in another variable.

aboutMinus = minus.description();

///// Question 5
// Set the age of the `Cat` instance you created in question 3 to one higher
// than its current age.

minus.age += 1;
